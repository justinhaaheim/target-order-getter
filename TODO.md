# ToDo

- [ ] Add retry logic if we don't get the data we're expecting, or if the page fails to load
- [ ] Try just hitting the target APIs directly, with the API key
- [ ] ‚≠ê Start integrating with crawlee for browser fingerprinting help. Not entirely clear how to fill in all the data from the separate request handlers, but it should be doable. Maybe just a big map/object keyed on order #, and then with properties filled in as we go?
